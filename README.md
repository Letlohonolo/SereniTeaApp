## Design Considerations

## Utilisation of GitHub and GitHub Actions

I will be utilising GitHub as a means of storage. I will be creating various branches for different aspects of the application and pushing my code to those branches. When i am done with that aspect i will then merge it with the main branches. Here the branches will be tested by the GitHub actions that i will implement. This will ensure that the specific branch runs well and has no errors. It will then allow for a merge with the main branch if there are no errors. GitHub Actions will help with the automated continuos testing to ensure that there are no error or bugs that can cause problems for the main branch
